      <h1 class="govuk-heading-l">Check if you can apply for a Farming Transformation Fund Improving Farm Productivity Grant</h1>
      <p>Use this service to:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>check if you are eligible to apply for a grant for your project (takes about 5 minutes)</li>
        <li>check how well your project fits the funding priorities (takes about 15 minutes if you have all the project details)</li>
      </ul>
      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Who can apply</h2>
      <span>You can apply if:</span>
      <ul>
        <li>you are a farmer and will do the grant-funded work in England</li>
        <li>you are an agricultural contractor and your business is registered in England</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Agricultural contractors cannot apply for solar project items.</p>
      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">What you can apply for</h2>
        <span>You can apply for up to:</span>
      <ul>
        <li>40% of estimated costs of farm productivity project items</li>
        <li>25% of estimated costs for solar project items</li>
      </ul>
      <p>For farm productivity project items, the maximum grant you can apply for is £500,000. The minimum grant is £25,000 (40% of £62,500).</p>
      <p>For solar project items, the maximum grant you can apply for is £100,000. The minimum grant is £15,000 (25% of £60,000). You can apply for grant funding to add solar project items (for example a battery) to a solar photovoltaic (PV) system you already have or to buy a new solar PV system.</p>
      <p>If you want to apply for both farm productivity and solar project grant funding, you must submit 2 separate applications. The maximum grant amount for both projects together is £500,000.</p>

        <li>an estimate of the total cost of the items</li>
